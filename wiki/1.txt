We are two computer science master students at FAU Erlangen. Our main 
target is to implement an adapted version of the famous Viola-Jones 
algorithm for facial recognition. Our version of this algorithm shall 
provide two modes. The first mode is cone-detection, which are typically 
used as street 
markings. The cones shall be correctly detected, and our RC car shall 
then drive through them autonomously.
The second mode shall provide street sign recognition with the correct 
reactions. For example, upon recognizing a stop sign, the RC car is 
obligated to stop, wait for some time and then continue driving.
Furthermore, after implementing those two modes, we will be trying to 
improve performance and driving skills.
